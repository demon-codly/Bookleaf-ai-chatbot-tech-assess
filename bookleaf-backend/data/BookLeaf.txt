=== CHUNK 019 ===
t your final manuscript through the dashboard, your book moves into the production 
queue. From this point onward, the steps differ slightly based on whether or not youve opted for 
any add-on services.

?? If You Have Not Opted for Any Add-On Services
(This is referred to as the Limited Publishing route)
Your book will be published in the following formats:
*	?? Paperback  available on the BookLeaf Publishing Store 


*	?? eBook  available on the BookLeaf Publishing Store 


The standard publishing timeline is:
*	? 30 to 45 business days from the date of your final submission 


During this period:
*	Your books status in the dashboard will appear as In Review 


*	Our editorial and production team will work on: 


o	File formatting and validation 


o	ISBN assignment 


o	Cover alignment and integration 


o	Preparing distribution assets

You do not need to follow up during this phase. Rest assured, our team ensures everything is 
progressing smoothly in the background.

?? If You Have Opted for the Bestseller Breakthrough Package
With this premium add-on, the entire publication process is fast-tracked.
The publishing timeline in this case is:
*	?? 18 to 22 business days from the date of your final submission 


During this process:
*	Your book status will still appear as In Review in the dashboard until publication is 
complete 


*	The internal steps (file validation, layout, listing, etc.) are prioritized in our queue 


?? Once your book is published, you will:

the nomination process to ensuring the integrity and professionalism of the selection, and then 
shipping and handling costs.

materials that recognize your achievement and can be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

Author Queries After Publication

?? How Is the Price of My Book Determined?
The final price of your book is set by our market strategy team based on multiple practical factors, 
including:
*	? Total number of pages 


*	? Cost of paper, printing, and GST 


*	? Cover printing (color) and lamination 


*	? Royalty margin for you as the author 


This pricing strategy ensures:
*	Your book remains competitively priced and marketable to readers 


*	Your royalty share is protected 


*	The book reflects its production value without overpricing 


?? We aim for a balance between value, quality, and sales potential.

?? How Are My Poems Protected?
We take your intellectual property and data security seriously. Heres how we protect your 
submissions:
*	Confidentiality Agreements: Every team member signs a binding agreement to maintain the 
confidentiality of author content. 


*	Secure

*	Secure Submission Systems: All dashboards and backends are encrypted and monitored. 


*	Strict Access Control: Only designated publishing team members have access to manuscript 
content. 


*	You Retain Full Ownership: We claim no rights over your poems. You are the sole copyright 
holder. 


*	Security Audits: Our system is reviewed periodically for vulnerabilities and compliance. 


? Your poems will never be shared, published elsewhere, or reused in any form without your 
explicit written consent.

?? Author Copies  Limited Publishing
If youve selected the Limited Publishing option (i.e., no add-on packages), heres what you receive:
*	A coupon code will be issued after publication 


*	The coupon allows you to order one free author copy via the BookLeaf online bookstore 


*	This is valid only for Indian authors 


?International authors are currently not eligible for a free copy

=== CHUNK 024 ===
valid only for Indian authors 


?International authors are currently not eligible for a free copy
You can use the coupon to order your paperback at your convenience for gifting, marketing, or 
personal collection. 

?? When Will I Receive My Author Copy Coupon Code?
*	Please check the confirmation email (which says your book has been published)  it 
contains a link to submit your review. We kindly request you to complete the review, and 
once its done, you will receive the coupon code within 10 business days. 


*	Once your review is submitted, your coupon code will be emailed within 10 business days 


This ensures we close the loop and gather author feedback while also enabling access to your copy.

?? Why Did I Receive a Coupon Code Instead of a Physical Author Copy?
Due to the volume of titles we publish and frequent courier issues, physical author copy deliveries 
have been challenging to manage at scale.
To ensure:
*	A faster and more reliable delivery experience 


*	A

To ensure:
*	A faster and more reliable delivery experience 


*	A better tracking experience for you 


...weve shifted to issuing coupon codes redeemable at the BookLeaf Store.
You can order your book at your preferred time and address using this code  cutting down delays 
and increasing flexibility.
?? For authors who chose Bestseller Breakthrough Package, the coupon code will not be sent, 
instead we will directly ship 5 copies to their address (applicable in India).

?? Why Am I Being Charged Delivery Fees for My Author Copy?
The author copy is free, but the delivery charge may still apply in the following cases:
*	Your address is in a remote or non-standard courier zone 


*	There is no free courier service available for your pincode 


In these cases, a minimal shipping charge may apply  we do not profit from this fee. It is solely to 
cover logistics.

?? What Does 100% Royalty Mean in the Bestseller Breakthrough Package?
When we say 100% royalty, it means:
You receive 100% of the profit from each sale  after all mandatory costs are deducted.
Heres what is deducted before calcul

=== CHUNK 027 ===

Heres what is deducted before calculating your royalty:
*	Printing and paper costs 


*	Platform commissions (e.g., Amazon's cut) 


*	Packaging and handling 


*	GST and transaction fees 


*	Discount structures and return buffers 


?? Example:
If your book is listed at ?150:
*	Total deductions might be ?80 (example) 


*	Your royalty will be calculated on the ?70 profit, not the ?150 price 


? This ensures you receive the entire profit, unlike standard publishing models where only a small 
fraction is shared.

deliver the award safely.


?? Can I Get a Draft Copy to Upload on KDP or Another Platform?
No, we do not provide draft files or source files for upload on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) or other 
platforms using our ISBN.
If you'd like to publish your book elsewhere, you are welcome to do so using:
*	A different ISBN 


*	A version that does not use our logo or branding 


?? Also note:
*	The eBook version of your book is exclusive to BookLeafs bookstore
*	Dual listing on Amazon via KDP using our ISBN is not allowed, to avoid publishing conflicts

? Why Is My Book Showing Out of Stock or Unavailable on Amazon?
This issue may appear occasionally due to Amazons internal system syncing delays. This is a common 
occurrence.
Heres what you should know:
*	Your book is still live and published in our system 


*	Amazon may temporarily show Currently Unavailable or Out of Stock 


*	This typically resolves within 2448 hours 


? What you should do:
*	Check the listing again after a few hours 


*	If the issue persists beyond 48 hours, raise a support ticket so we can escalate it 




?? Why Isnt My Book Marked as Prime on Amazon Yet?
As soon as your book is listed on Amazon.in, we submit a request for it to be made Prime eligible.
However:
*	The decision and timeline is entirely controlled by Amazon 


*	Approval may take time due to their internal review process 


We are actively monitoring your listing and will follow up as needed. Thank you for your patience

?? I Have Amazon Prime  Why Am I Still Being Charged Delivery?
Even if you're a Prime member, Amazon sometimes applies shipping fees on:
*	Print-on-demand products 


*	Books fulfilled by third-party sellers 


Since BookLeaf books are POD (print-on-demand), Amazon handles the shipping fee directly.
?? We do not control Amazons delivery charges and cannot remove them, even for Prime users.



?? Post-Publishing Changes (Add-On)
If youve purchased the Post-Publishing Changes service:
1.	We will begin the update process within 45 business days after your purchase

For authors enrolled in the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, royalties are paid on-demand
meaning you can request a royalty payout anytime after your book has been live for at least 30 
business days.
This 30-day window allows for:
*	Completion of initial reporting cycles from platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
*	Validation of sales data
*	Processing of any returns or adjustments

?? eBook & ?? Paperback Royalty Structure
We are committed to full transparency when it comes to your royalty earnings.
Your detailed sales report (with royalty breakdowns) is available at: 
 ?? https://ebooks.bookleafpub.com/sales-reports

?? eBook Royalty:
*	You receive 80% royalty on the net sale price of each eBook sold through our store (unless 
your package includes 100% royalty). 


*	This ensures that you benefit from most of the profits while keeping the book attractively 
priced for reade

=== CHUNK 035 ===
ures that you benefit from most of the profits while keeping the book attractively 
priced for readers. 



?? Paperback Royalty:
Paperback royalty is calculated differently and depends on the following:
*	Platform discounts 


*	Printing cost 


*	GST (Goods & Services Tax) 


*	Packaging and handling charges 


*	Distribution and return expenses 


?? Royalty Formula:
Selling Price  Printing & Market Access Charges = Your Royalty Base
Then:
*	If you're on the regular publishing model: you get 80% of this amount 


*	If you're on the Bestseller Breakthrough Package: you get 100% of this amount 


To calculate your royalty, you can use our Royalty Calculator here: 
 ?? https://www.bookleafpub.in/printing-cost-royalty-calculator


? What Does 80% Royalty Mean?
When we say 80% royalty, it refers to 80% of the profit earned, not 80% of the book's listed price.
The books listed price includes:
*	Printing cost 


*	Platform fees (e.g., Amazon commission) 


*	GST and other

=== CHUNK 036 ===
ed price includes:
*	Printing cost 


*	Platform fees (e.g., Amazon commission) 


*	GST and other taxes 


*	Handling and packaging 


*	Distribution & return costs 


*	Platform discounts (e.g., Amazon often takes 2550% off MRP)

Example:
If your book is listed at ?150 on Amazon:
*	?40 may go toward printing 


*	?45 may be deducted by Amazon (platform discount + fees + taxes) 


*	Remaining profit: ?65 


*	Youll receive 80% of ?65 = ?52 


You can use our royalty calculator for an accurate estimate: 
 ?? https://www.bookleafpub.in/printing-cost-royalty-calculator

?? Understanding 100% Royalty (For Bestseller Breakthrough Authors Only)
If youve purchased the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, you're eligible for 100% royalty.
This means:
*	You receive the entire profit (after deductions) from each sale. 


*	You still dont receive 100% of the listed price  platform costs and printing still apply. 


Example:
If your book is listed at ?150:
*	Printing + taxes + fees

=== CHUNK 037 ===
sts and printing still apply. 


Example:
If your book is listed at ?150:
*	Printing + taxes + fees = ?60 


*	Net profit = ?90 


*	Youll receive ?90 as your royalty 


This model ensures the entire profit margin goes to you.
Again, use the Royalty calculator to view detailed estimations.



?? If a Bestseller Breakthrough Author Requests Royalty Payout
If youve opted for the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, you are entitled to request your royalty any 
time  there is no minimum payout threshold.
Simply inform us through the helpdesk whenever you wish to receive your royalty payout. We will 
verify and process your request accordingly.
